            <h1>Front-End Developer Test</h1>
            <p>This front-end development test is designed to assess your skills in markup writing, CSS styling, and
                responsiveness. The test will evaluate your ability to identify layout issues and solve them accurately.</p>

                <p>Some suggestions before you begin:</p>
                <p>- Read the instructions carefully. <br>
                - Using Visual Studio Code as editor is not mandatory but recommended. <br>
                - Using the Live Server extension may help you debug your code. <br>
                - Use Dev Tools on your browser to debug your code. <br>
                - Make sure that you are working in the <strong>index.html</strong> file. <br>
                - Styling is intended to be made using pure CSS but SCSS is allowed if you're more comfortable with it. <br>
                - The last part of the test is combined with the Back-End test, so make sure to read both instructions before proceeding.
                </p>

            <h2>Section 01</h2>
            <p>This first part of the test requires problem solving to complete. Fix the following layout by adjusting
                spacing and grouping elements, making it look similar to the example provided below. For this part, you
                will need to modify the <strong>test.css</strong> file and this <strong>index.html</strong></p>

        <section class="container part-two">
            <h2>Section 02</h2>
            <p>This part of the test requires you make a responsive grid layout that will be composed by three columns
                as shown below when a <strong>desktop view</strong> is active. <br><br>
                When a <strong>mobile view</strong> is active, the layout will be composed by two rows, the first one
                taking the whole width of the container and the second
                one having two equal columns. <br><br>
                For this part, you will need to modify the <strong>test2.css</strong> file and this
                <strong>index.html</strong>
            </p>

        <section class="container part-three">
            <h2>Section 03</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">In this final section of the test, you must validate the information provided by the user, in this case, make sure that the selected name exists, the age is between 18 and 99, and the email address is valid. You should achieve this using vanilla <strong>Javascript</strong> but jQuery is also allowed. <br><br>

                After validating the data, you must connect to a database (Back-End Test) and retrieve the remaining information to finally display it on the card below the form. <br><br>

                Your scripts are already linked to this file, you will only need to modify the <strong>test.js</strong> file in this directory.
