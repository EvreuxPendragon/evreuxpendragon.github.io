            <h1>Back-End Developer Test</h1>
            <p>This back-end development test is designed to assess your skills working with APIs and databases. The
                test will evaluate your ability to identify layout issues and solve them accurately.</p>

            <p>Some suggestions before you begin:</p>
            <p>- Read the instructions carefully. <br>
                - Using Visual Studio Code as editor is not mandatory but recommended. <br>
                - Using the Live Server extension may help you debug your code. <br>
                - Use Dev Tools on your browser to debug your code. <br>
                - Make sure that you are working in the <strong>backendTest.html</strong> file. <br>
                - Styling is not required for this test, but if you wish to style what you see, please do so. <br>
                - The last part of the test is combined with the Front-End test, so make sure to read both instructions
                before proceeding.
            </p>

            <h2>Section 01</h2>
            <p>This first part of the test requires working with APIs. Please connect to time API to get the current
                time in your time zone. After that, please display said time in the clock labled <strong>Local
                    Time.</strong> Make the time live update so that it updates every second. After that, please also
                display the current time in <strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong> in the respective clock. Also live update this
                clock. You will need to modify the <strong>backend.js</strong> file in this directory.</p>

            <p>
                This part will simulate you saving data on to a database. Since we don't currently have a database we
                will create json objects instead. <br><br>
                The following form will have 3 inputs: <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Age</strong>, and
                <strong>Email</strong>. <br><br>
                When the submit button gets clicked, 3 things should happen: <br>
                <strong>1. </strong>We should validate the data to make sure we're not adding the same person more than
                once. <br>
                <strong>2. </strong>An employee ID shoudl be generated if the data is valid. <br>
                <strong>3. </strong>We should add the data to the database. Or in our case, the json object. <br><br>
            </p>
